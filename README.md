- 👋 Hi, I’m @RIFFDIDDYS - I feel like I have made something special.  That would give people the feeling of being their favorite band, singer, musican or song they have in there head.  I just have no idea on what to do with it.  I spent all day trying to figure all this out because I think I entered a world where I have made it possiable.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... getting the TMMMIDGT in the hands of someone like STEM or NASA and built at a toy companines.  I would also like to send a recording of the sound it makes to someone who knows someone that knows about music, music theripy, or making things.

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Finding the George Forman of Rock and Roll Music. I have narrowed it down to MTV DJ's or the people at AXS TV. That is were I was trying before and I think did something wrong with prior art but I only put the horriable sound it make in the recordings.  There is a reason why - Like say I am playing along to Imagine - well I am playing along to the words that John Lennon is singing or what ever instrument is playing when he is not and it sounds amazing and when I find the tune - I like a dopimine rush.  So back to my therory about the recording sound is if someone listens to it - they hear the untuneness because they are not hearing the sylibals of the words because they are listing to the fimilair sound of hearing Imagine. 

- 👀 I’m interested in ... I would also be interested in finding like a hardware chain, or hobby store, or like the Scoots or STEM or like NASA. People are gonna need a lot of time with music up there in space and I promise YOU this will deliver and I am wrong - I also have made the best SPACE CORD - a work out that I designed for people in low gravity.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to make the best TMMMIDGT I have ever made.  I have one I am building right know and I cant wait to hear if it sounds as good as I think. But in my head earlier - I was telling my Dad how I was gonna make the next one and I can not wait to hear what that sounds like.  But the new design can attach I think to anything.  Well things people have around the house.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... On what I have made with someone who with some who can see the vision I see with what I ahve made with one of these next to every hospital bed have a francise deal with people who want to make these and sell them at fairs, concerts, and motorsports venues.

- 📫 How to reach me ... Please let me learn how to code first so I can fill in some more of the above spaces.
