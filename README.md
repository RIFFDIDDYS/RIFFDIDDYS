- 👋 Hi, I’m @RIFFDIDDYS - I feel like I have made something special.  That would give people the feeling of being their favorite band, singer, musican or song they have in there head.  I just have no idea on what to do with it.  I spent all day trying to figure all this out because I think I entered a world where I have made it possiable.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... getting the TMMMIDGT in the hands of someone like STEM or NASA and built at a toy companines.  I would alos like to send a recording of the sound it makes to someone who knows someone that knows about music, music theripy, or making things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How to code and the importance of the meaning of coding.  I also wanted to say I have creative writers problem where my teacher just to me to type something and I typed the thing about the job.  Also I thought I could cut and paste the notes fix them, so I am learning.  I aslo learned when I hit the commit change button it means something and I will delete above tomorrow and put something more meaningful.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... On what I have made.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please let me learn how to code first so I can fill in some more of the above spaces.
