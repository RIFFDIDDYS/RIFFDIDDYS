- 👋 Hi, I’m @RIFFDIDDYS
-HELLO WORLD.  If you could give the gift of music - woun't YOU just try to do everything posiable to do it.
- I have still have no idea on what I am doing here, but I was just looking to do the free patent thing at Patent dot Gov for one one the thousands of ideas I have - I just figured if I could do it my myself - I would give it a try on something I don care about like my Couch Surfer - it like one of those thing Brook Sheilds fell of off, but a whole lot safer.  Their balacnce board is dangerous - mine is like riding a bucking horse with all of the fun of falling back int the couch while watch TV.
👀 I’m interested in ... Finding someone who beleive me on what I have made.  I am not sure if I am taking a class on codeing or not - Please give me a second chance now that I know how this works. I am old and know knothing about computers - so like the this stuff I am not use to. 
  - I just came here to figure things out - I don't see my last thing I wrote here - but I have to edit it to if I can find it I think in the notes.   I sure wish those notes I wrote were here.
- 👀 I’m interested in Doing what every I can to get the newest version that I have made is different from the last version fixing all of the mistakes of the last 25 versions of the TMMMIDGT.
- I am gonna wait to see if the notes apair here tomorrow.

  


- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I thought I was taking a "how to patent class" now I think I am learning coding because somehow I got hear. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... With whoever wants to know what a TMMMIDGT is?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here I guess - well somewhere on this website that I think I am trying to figure out - I am sure there is a message button.

- THANKS RIFFDIDDYS
