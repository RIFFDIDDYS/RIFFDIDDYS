- 👋 Hi, I’m @RIFFDIDDYS
- I have no idea on what I am doing here, but I was just looking to do the free patent thing at Patent dot Gov for one one the thousands of ideas I have - I just figured if I could do it my myself - I would give it a try on something I don care about like my Couch Surfer - it like one of those thing Brook Sheilds fell of off, but a whole lot safer.  Their balacnce board is dangerous - mine is like riding a bucking horse with all of the fun of falling back int the couch while watch TV.
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Doing what every I can to get the newest version that is different from the last version fixing all of the mistakes of the last 25 versions of the TMMMIDGT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I thought I was taking a "how to patent class" now I think I am learning coding because somehow I got hear. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... With whoever wants to know what a TMMMIDGT is?
- 📫 How to reach me ... Here I guess - well somewhere on this website that I think I am trying to figure out - I am sure there is a message button.

- THANKS RIFFDIDDYS
