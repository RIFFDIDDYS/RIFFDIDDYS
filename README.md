- 👋 Hi, I’m @RIFFDIDDYS - I feel like I have made something special.  That would give people the feeling of being their favorite band, singer, musican or song they have in there head.  I just have no idea on what to do with it.  I spent all day trying to figure all this out because I think I entered a world where I have made it possiable.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... getting the TMMMIDGT in the hands of someone like STEM or NASA and built at a toy companines.  I would alos like to send a recording of the sound it makes to someone who knows someone that knows about music, music theripy, or making things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to make the best TMMMIDGT I have ever made.  I have one I am building right know and I cant wait to hear if it sounds as good as I think. But in my head earlier - I was telling my Dad how I was gonna make the next one and I can not wait to hear what that sounds like.  But the new design can attach I think to anything.  Well things people have around the house.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... On what I have made.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Please let me learn how to code first so I can fill in some more of the above spaces.
